# CrimeBuster - a crime reporting system
---

Crime Buster service is greatly benefiting from the mass data collected by Seattle Police Department. The project is developed to both host the mass amount of existing data, but also providing a new crime reporting service to the public.

Data mining was performed on the existing data to find out more project insights, and overlaid on top of external data sources such Seattle Weather data, and City Construction permit to find out more data trends. 

The project was developed mainly using technologies including **mySQL, JDBC, JSP, HTML, CSS**.
